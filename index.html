      <p>
        it got better-<br>
        <br>
        the transitions in life<br>
        it put us all at ease.<br>
        the paths seem somewhat bright<br>
        realities from our dreams.<br>
        <br>
        then something big happened<br>
        in year twenty nineteen,<br>
        we're having a hard time<br>
        with life in quarantine.<br>
        <br>
        preventing contractions,<br>
        and now sheltered-in-place;<br>
        year twenty twenty's start<br>
        felt like it went to waste.<br>
        <br>
        but that's negativity <br>
        and that's not what we need,<br>
        there's more to being safe<br>
        than not leaving as pleased.<br>
        <br>
        right, it's overwhelming,<br>
        but continue to hope.<br>
        continue to uplift,<br>
        that's a good way to cope.<br>
        <br>
        it is temporary.<br>
        it was better before.<br>
        once again we will wait,<br>
        for reality once more.<br>
        <br>
        -it gets better.
